# rf-query

Testing out some ideas.

- Should support some of the same features as TanStack Query
- Should work better with Cljs datastructures
- Response data should be usable in Re-frame event/effect handlers?
  - Is it feasible? How to check if the query status is OK?
- What is the lib API - functions or re-frame?
